# Hello-world
Getting started
I am starting a new project after a long absence from any type of programming work. Furthermore, i need to start learning PHP, about which I know nothing. I never knew one could even do applications outside of Visual Studio. First goal, what to actually write/edit PHP in. Second goal, learn how to do something/anything in PHP. Third goal, figure out how to migrate backend tables from MySQL to MS SQL Server because I have no idea how to automate reporting in MySQL.
